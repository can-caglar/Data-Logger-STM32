# Data logger:

- [ ] Perhaps write a new UART handler module,
leave the CLI one as it is for now. we can refactor the CLI module
to use the new UART handler if required.

SD card:
- [blocked] Write a test app to use the SD card device w/SPI
- [ ] Write a UART module with DMA that continuously 
writes to the circular buffer will be handled by the DMA.

Baud rate / Application Decider
- [...] Make use of the blinky module, remove the adapters, make tests work
    - [x] Mock the "system" HAL and eventually remove "system_hal.h/c"
    - [ ] Re-develop the "gpio_interrupts" module via TDD.
- [ ] Rewrite the button module so it is a DIP switch module instead

Possible Refactors:
- [ ] The CLI to use the same UART module with circular buffer?

Files:
- [ ] Tidy file / folder structure in Keil and in the src folder

Future:
- [ ] Add small OLED(?) screen
