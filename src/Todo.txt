Snooping application:

- [ ] Perhaps write a new UART handler module,
leave the CLI one as it is for now. we can refactor the CLI module
to use the new UART handler if required.

- [ ] Write a test app to use the SD card device w/SPI
- [ ] Write circular buffer module
- [ ] Write UART interface which uses HAL uart with interrupt
where it pushes to circular buffer each interrupt (turn off interrupts here?)
- [ ] And when read, it will pop

Baud rate / Application Decider
- [ ] Make use of the blinky module, remove the adapters, make tests work
- [ ] Rewrite the button module so it is a DIP switch module instead

Possible Refactorings:
- [ ] The CLI to use the same UART module with circular buffer?
