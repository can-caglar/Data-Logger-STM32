# Data Logger++ Tasks:

- [ ] Variable names (namely make MVC pattern more obvious)
- [x] Reduce size of program
- [x] Do not read circ buf if it's empty
- [x] Remove context argument from data holder, it doesn't need it
    - [x] Remove refresh too. and give data if/when requested
- [x] Upgrade uC so we can increase size of buffers
- [ ] Understand fatfs better; it seems to buffer internally, 
    so perhaps writing 1 byte at a time is OK for performance
- [ ] Upgrade processor to one with more RAM.
    - [x] Update processor speed
    - [x] Update SPI speed
    - [x] Increase circular buffer size
    - [ ] Update I2C wiring (PB7 SDA, PB6 SCL, AF4)
        - [ ] Remove the solder bridge SB16 else I2C and SPI will clash.
    - [ ] Remove solder bridge to allow the device to be plugged into the wall
    - [x] Update USART (usart1 -> usart2, new alt func)
    - [x] Check SD card library works
    - [ ] Write a benchmarking test for the SD card - what is the write throughput?
        - Sending 1 byte per loop, vs 512, vs 1024, 2048, vs 4096
        - Turn off FF_FS_TINY?
        - Try higher SPI speed
        - Run the test a few times, perhaps 5 times each and get an average
    - [-] Use internal RTC | No VBAT on this particular chip (LQFP32)
        See page 31 LQFP32 pinout of STM32F303x6/x8 Datasheet for this info.
    - [ ] Research baud rate detection
    - [ ] Research the 4Kb of CCM RAM we have on this chip.
- [x] Update tests so they pass again with this new chip
- [x] Test circular buffer capacity that is not a power of 2 to make it as large as possible.
