# Data Logger Tasks:

- [ ] Perhaps write a new UART handler module,
leave the CLI one as it is for now. we can refactor the CLI module
to use the new UART handler if required.

CLI:
- [x] Print a welcome message at start which tells users how to navigate
    - [ ] Build the welcome message using variables in modules
- [ ] Refactor the string manipulation for the "MyProcessor" module
- [ ] Handle malicious input - add a \0 to the incoming strings to limit size

SD card:
- [x] Write a test app to use the SD card device w/SPI
    - [x] Try another SD card breakout
        - [-] Try on an Ardunio
- [x] Treat the SD driver as a black box and add it to our current system.
- [x] Add SD card functions to the CLI
- [ ] Write a UART module with DMA that continuously 
writes to the circular buffer which will be handled by the DMA.

Baud rate / Application Decider
- [x] Make use of the blinky module, remove the adapters, make tests work
    - [x] Mock the "system" HAL and eventually remove "system_hal.h/c"
    - [ ] Re-develop the "gpio_interrupts" module via TDD (currently not done with TDD)
- [x] Create a 4-way DIP switch module

Possible Refactors:
- [ ] The CLI to use the same UART module with circular buffer?

Files / folders:
- [ ] Tidy file / folder structure in Keil and in the src folder
- [ ] Rename modules (MySM is no longer a state machine, and DIP module uses both Dip and DIP )

Realtime clock:
- [ ] Add realtime clock for SD card saving and logging

Misc:
- [ ] Add versioning which displays on UART

Future:
- [ ] Add small OLED(?) screen
- [ ] Add external realtime clock with battery
