# Data Logger Tasks:

- [x] Perhaps write a new UART handler module,
leave the CLI one as it is for now. we can refactor the CLI module
to use the new UART handler if required.

CLI:
- [x] Print a welcome message at start which tells users how to navigate
    - [ ] Build the welcome message using variables in modules
- [ ] Refactor the string manipulation for the "MyProcessor" module
- [ ] Handle malicious input - add a \0 to the incoming strings to limit size

SD card:
- [x] Write a test app to use the SD card device w/SPI
    - [x] Try another SD card breakout
        - [-] Try on an Ardunio
- [x] Treat the SD driver as a black box and add it to our current system.
- [x] Add SD card functions to the CLI
writes to the circular buffer which will be handled by the DMA.
- [x] Make fatfs smaller via ffconf configs
- [x] Don't light LED if fatfs init fails

Baud rate / Application Decider
- [x] Make use of the blinky module, remove the adapters, make tests work
    - [x] Mock the "system" HAL and eventually remove "system_hal.h/c"
    - [ ] Re-develop the "gpio_interrupts" module via TDD (currently not done with TDD)
- [x] Create a 4-way DIP switch module
- [!] Make DIP switch decide baud rate
    - [ ] Make it on the fly?

Snooping application
- [x] Write UART library using STM32 HAL,
    - [x] Experiment with it. Make it use DMA and fill RAM? | Use interrupt
- [x] When receiving, toggle the LED
- [x] Timestamp each line (\n) of message

Possible Refactors:
- [ ] The CLI to use the same UART module with circular buffer?

Files / folders:
- [ ] Tidy file / folder structure in Keil and in the src folder
- [ ] Rename modules (MySM is no longer a state machine, and DIP module uses both Dip and DIP )

Misc:
- [ ] Add versioning which displays on UART
- [ ] Increase the length of command entered? (40 characters?)
- [ ] Test fast UART input (we may need to increase size)
- [ ] Optimise RAM usage (bss, data)

Realtime clock:
- [x] Think about abstraction and layers
    - [x] RTC module with I2C
    - [x] A string manip module on top of that
- [x] Add RTC to the fatfs module so files get right date when opened
- [x] Update the filenames
- [x] Fix the seconds bug

Future:
- [ ] Add small OLED(?) screen
