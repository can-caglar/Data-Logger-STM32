# Data Logger++ Tasks:

- [ ] Variable names (namely make MVC pattern more obvious)
- [x] Reduce size of program
- [x] Do not read circ buf if it's empty
- [x] Remove context argument from data holder, it doesn't need it
    - [x] Remove refresh too. and give data if/when requested
- [x] Upgrade uC so we can increase size of buffers
- [ ] Understand fatfs better; it seems to buffer internally, 
    so perhaps writing 1 byte at a time is OK for performance
- [ ] Upgrade processor to one with more RAM.
    - [x] Update processor speed
    - [x] Update SPI speed
    - [x] Increase circular buffer size
    - [-] Update I2C wiring (PB7 SDA, PB6 SCL, AF4)
    - [x] Update USART (usart1 -> usart2, new alt func)
    - [x] Check SD card library works
    - [ ] Turn off FF_FS_TINY?
    - [ ] Do a stress test with this new board
    - [ ] Use internal RTC
    - [ ] Look into baud rate detection
