# Data Logger++ Tasks:

- [ ] Variable names (namely make MVC pattern more obvious)
- [x] Reduce size of program
- [x] Do not read circ buf if it's empty
- [x] Remove context argument from data holder, it doesn't need it
    - [x] Remove refresh too. and give data if/when requested
- [ ] Upgrade uC so we can increase size of buffers
- [ ] Understand fatfs better; it seems to buffer internally, 
    so perhaps writing 1 byte at a time is OK for performance
- [ ] Upgrade processor to one with more RAM.
    - Turn off FF_FS_TINY
    - Update SPI speed if possible
    - Increase circular buffer size
