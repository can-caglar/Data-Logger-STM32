- [x] Capture schematic
    - [x] Same as prototype version but without on-board ST link
        - [x] LED to indicate power
        - [x] LED to indicate receive (rx)
        - [x] LED to indicate transmit (tx)
        - [x] LED to indicate errors
        - [x] SWDIO for programming it
        - [x] Test points for comms
        - [x] Test points for GND
        - [x] USB for power only
        - [-] Power also from external supply?
        - [x] Current consumption header
        - [x] Pull up UART / SPI / I2C lines
        - [x] Use fuse for overcurrent protection
        - [x] Crystal, or crystal oscillator for stm32 uc
        - [x] Pins to expose UART
        - [x] USB mini
- [x] Draw layout
    - [-] Silkscreen
        - On the back, explain how to use it
- [x] Order
- [ ] Board bring-up
    - [x] Ensure 3v3 power led to lights up | there was an issue with the mask on the back plane causing a short (maybe forgot to do refill before
        generating gerbers). fixed it by cutting traces around the short.
    - [x] Program and debug the device | bad solder joints on the SWDIO and 3v3 line on the stm32 was causing issues. now it programs fine.
        - note: no reset line, but the system still seems to respect the reset button on Keil and start debugging from the beginning.
        - note2: the only pins connected are GND, SWDIO, SWCLK and 3v3 (to ST link pin 1 (Target Vcc).
    - [x] Set RTC time
        - [x] RTC doesn't retain time sometimes and resets, why? | the GND plane wasn't making contact with the battery - added
            solder there and now it's ok.
    - [ ] The "Save" LED (blue) doesn't light up - resistor val too high?
    - [x] Check soldering for the DIP switch - always returning 0xFF | was a bad solder joint
- [x] Code changes:
    - [x] No-pull on the dip switch I/O
